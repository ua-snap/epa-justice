    "We can see here that the ACS uses -666666666 as a no data value.  We also see a discrepancy between our total population computed for zip code 99709 in the DHC data and the ACS disability number: the DHC adds up to 28613, while ACS says 31936 people have a disability! What gives? It might be because the ACS has a different resident definition than the DHC, and that the ACS numbers are all technically estimates and not direct counts. See [here](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_general_handbook_2020_ch09.pdf) and [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/comparing-acs-data.html) for some clues.\n"
