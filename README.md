US Census data access via API

This is an exploratory repo that demonstrates access to the US Census Data via their [API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html). It includes some basic helper functions and lookup tables to support the EPA-Justice-HIA project which may pull demographic data from the US Census for use in SNAP climate tools.
